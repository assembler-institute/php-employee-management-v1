# Employee Management

This project is based on a employee manager, which allows users to perform CRUD operations over a database of employees, saved in a json file. The application makes use of user sessions, encrypted passwords and the use of external web servers to get employees avatars.

## Installation

Clone the repository.

```
 git clone https://github.com/sanadriu/php-employee-management-v1.git
```

Install dependencies.

```
 npm install
```

If you are not going to use XAMPP, ensure that **PROJECT_FOLDER** constant is **null** and run the next command to serve the PHP application:

```
  php -S localhost:3000
```

Otherwise, if you are going to introduce the project in **htdocs** folder, specify the name of the folder for **PROJECT_FOLDER** constant.

In order to use fetch avatars, you will have to uncomment **extension=curl** in **php.ini** file. Otherwise, PHP will fail.
