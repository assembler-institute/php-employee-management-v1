## Where to start?üöÄ

### Requirementsüìã

To run this project you need yo have XAMPP installed in your PC (or MUMP in the case of Mac users). For more information about XAMPP visit [their website](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html).

### Installüîß

To clone this repository you have make in terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/mhfortuna/php-employee-management-v1.git
```
Then you need to copy this folder to `htdocs` or change the server root variable.

## Deploymentüì¶

To open the file explorer just open a browser and go to [localhost](localhost)
You'll have to login, the credentials are:
```
email: admin@assemblerschool.com
pass: 123456
```

## How to use üíª

### Dashboard page
After you have logged in the application you'll see a grid with some of the employees data. From there you can add new employees or delete them. If you double click on an employee you can see more data in a new page called the **employee page**. If you press on the employee icon it will redirect you to the **employee page** too, but this time you'll have a form to create a new employee.

### Employee page
This page renders conditionaly of how you accesed it:
- Case 1 - double click on employee from dashboard:
In this view you will see the available employee data, and you can update any of the fields. It the `id` doesn't exist it will show an error and redirect you to the dashboard.
- Case 3 - Click on the employee icon from dashboard:
In this view you'll see the empty form to create a new employee. There are mandatory fields to fill. When you submit the new employee it will show a modal and redirect you to the dashboard.

## Project structure üìÅ

```
assets/
resources/
src/
 /library
```

- Assets contains html, css, js & images
- Css just css files.
- Resources folder contains users.json and employees.json
- Src folder contains PHP files which contain HTML or JS
- Src/library folder contains PHP files that contain just PHP



We use some naming conventions when create code files. For instance a file which handles HTTP request we name it as `Controller`.

In the other hand we have also the concept of `Manager` which typically implements an abstraction layer over a storage system, in this case as we are going to work with json files for a while (bear on mind later we refactor it to MySQL and then we will also have a `Model` file) we would need to create on it all functions we need to access the json file.

The user is stored in `resouces/users.json` file there you have an admin user work with it.

The employees are stored `resouces/employees.json` file you have to make a CRUD over this file

## Tools and tecnologies used üõ†Ô∏è

* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* jsGrid
* Bootstrap 

## Project requirements üìè

- All code included comments need to be write in English
- Use a code style like camelCase
- HTML never use inline styles
- It is recommended to divide the tasks into several subtasks so that you can associate each particular step of the construction with a specific commit
- You should try as much as possible that the commits and planned tasks are the same
 - You must create a correctly documented README.md file in the root directory of the project (see guidelines in Resources)
